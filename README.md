# Solidity Smart Contract: Understanding require(), assert(), and revert()

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. These statements are essential for enforcing preconditions, validating internal state, and handling exceptional cases in smart contract development.

## Requirements

To interact with the smart contract, you'll need:
- A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- An Ethereum wallet or client (e.g., MetaMask) to deploy and interact with the contract on a testnet or mainnet
